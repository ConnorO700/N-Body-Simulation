3 bodies with equal masses that move around in a figure-8 shape that rotates about the origin.

Creator of the universe: Kevin Wayne

Sample execution: java-introcs NBody 157788000.0 25000.0 < figure8-rotating.txt

The data was taken from Table 3.2 of https://info.maths.ed.ac.uk/assets/files/Projects/9.pdf

and modified in the following ways:
  * Divide masses by G = 6.67e-11 to use the standard gravitational constant (instead of 1).
  * Scale the positions by 10^12; the velocities by 10^6; and the masses by 10^24 in order
    to make the standard values of Tau and dt (157788000.0 and 25000.0) good command-line
    arugments.
